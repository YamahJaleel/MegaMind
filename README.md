# Unbeatable-AI

This unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI uses the minimax algorithm to evaluate every possible move and outcome of the game in order to determine the best move to make at any given point. The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that is commonly used in game theory and artificial intelligence. It works by assigning a score to each possible move, based on the likelihood of winning or losing the game from that point. The AI then makes the move that leads to the highest score, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.
In order to make the Tic-Tac-Toe AI unbeatable, it has been programmed to evaluate every possible game state that could result from each possible move. This involves creating a game tree with all the possible moves, and assigning a score to each leaf node based on whether it represents a win, loss, or tie for the AI. The algorithm then propagates the scores back up the tree, selecting the move that leads to the best outcome.
Additionally, the AI is also able to predict the opponent's move to play optimally, so it has an understanding of the game strategy. This AI uses the minimax algorithm to be a perfect player that can never lose the game, because it always chooses the move that leads to a tie or a win.
